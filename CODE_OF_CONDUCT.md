# Code of conduct

We expect Holinoti's contributors to conduct themselves professionally. 
Since our primary mode of communication is text on an online forum 
(e.g. issue, pull request, comment, email, or chat text) 
devoid of vocal tone, gestures, or other context that is often vital to understanding, 
it is especially important that you convey these attitudes in text. 
<br>
<br>
This includes the following behaviors: 
<br>
<br>
 **Assume positive intent.** When someone posts something we expect community members
 will assume positive intent on the part of the post. 
 We may choose to disagree with the idea and reject the suggestion, 
 but we expect that it was made in order to be supportive of the community goals. 
<br>
<br>
 **Respectful to participants.** We expect participants will disagree on aspects of this project. 
 Disagreements must remain professional. 
 Even if we reject someone’s idea, we continue to welcome their participation. 
 And if your idea is rejected, be more persuasive not bitter. 
<br>
<br>
 **Seek to understand.** Open Source projects can be learning experiences. 
 When someone poses something you find disagreeable or you don’t understand it, inquire about it.
 Ask, explore, challenge, and then assert if you agree or disagree. 
<br>
<br>
 **Welcoming to new members.** New members bring fresh perspectives. 
 Many will raised questions that have been addressed before, 
 You can point them to existing discussions for them to get up to speed. 
 Don’t punish them for being new to the project -- everyone is new to every project once. 
<br>
<br>
 **Kind to beginners.** Beginners use open source projects to get experience. 
 They might not be talented coders yet, and projects should not accept poor quality code. 
 But we were all beginners once, and we need to to reject code with kindness. 
<br>
<br> 
 **Consider your impact on others.** Your work will be used by others, and you depend on the work of others. 
 We expect community members to be considerate and establish a balance their self-interest with communal interest. 
<br>
<br>
 **Use words carefully.** We may not understand intent when you say something ironic. 
 Poe’s Law suggests that without an emoticon is it likely that someone will misinterpret sarcasm. 
 We ask community members to communicate plainly. 
 <br>
 <br>
 **Exit with class.** There may come a time where you stop believing in 
 the project direction or get frustrated with the project leaders. 
 You are always free to fork the code and create a competitive project. 
 Open Source explicitly accommodates this. It does not have to be dramatic or bitter. 
 Sometimes you just walk away, and it’s OK.
