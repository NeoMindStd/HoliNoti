Welcome
-------

We invite you to join our team! Everyone is welcome to contribute code
via pull requests, to file issues on GitHub, to help people asking for
help on our mailing lists to help triage, reproduce, or fix bugs that people 
have filed, to add to our documentation, or to help out in any other way.

We grant commit access (which includes full rights to the issue
database, such as being able to edit labels) to people who have gained
our trust and demonstrated a commitment to Holinoti.

Helping out in the issue database
---------------------------------

If you want to help us triage, you are very welcome to do so!

* Read [our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates explicitly
   that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. If you're helping out
   with triage, you are representing the Holinoti team, and so you want to make sure to
   make a good impression!

are strongly recommended to go through these documents in the order
presented.

1. [Our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates explicitly
   that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. This
   also documents our conflict resolution policy and encourages people
   to ask questions.

2. [Setting up your framework development environment](README.md),
   which describes the steps you need to configure your computer to
   work on Holinoti's framework. Holinoti's framework uses Spring boot and Flutter
